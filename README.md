# PowerBI Project :: Astronaut
The aim of this project was to produce one page Power BI Report showing the history of manned space flight. 

## Background to problem statement:
A researcher at the institute of space study in the UK would like to create an exhibition detailing the history of space flight throughout the last 60 years. To do so, it wants to create several visualisations showing the growth of space exploration by human over the period. One of this visualisation, should contain number of astronauts in space on each and every year for the whole periods starting from the 1st mission with Yuri Gagarin to the last.

The following events of interest should be especially highlighted in the report:
1. First manned space flight by Yuri Gagarin in 1934.
2. Moon landing with Apollo 11 in 1969 by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.
3. First Chinese manned mission with Shenzhou 5 in 2005 by Yang Liwei.

The visualisation should be in one page of Power BI report but could have as many visual as needed. The problem statement requires to consider that visualisation will be printed on a ‘A2’ size poster for the exhibition.
